# Facial-Recognition-using-LDA

## System
- Capable of identifying a person from a digital image by comparing specific facial features from the image and face database

## Approach
- For training purposes, used the first five images of each subject to train the subspace
- For testing purposes, use the last five images of each subject for performance evaluation
- Perform dimentionality reduction while preserving as much of the class discriminatory as possible
- Find directions along which the classes are separated best
